b'Four people are on this side of the bridge. Everyone has to get across. \nProblem is that it\xe2\x80\x99s dark and so you can\xe2\x80\x99t cross the bridge without a flashlight and they only have one flashlight. \nPlus the bridge is only big enough for two people to cross at once. \nThe four people walk at different speeds:\n\n\none fella is so fast it only takes him 1 minute to cross the bridge,\nanother 2 minutes,\na third 5 minutes,\nthe last it takes 10 minutes to cross the bridge.\n\n\nWhen two people cross the bridge together (sharing the flashlight), they both walk at the slower person\xe2\x80\x99s pace. What is the minimum time required for all 4 to cross the bridge.\nRespond with a number which represents the number of minutes.\n\nAnswer is a integer.  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.\nFeel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions\n\n'
