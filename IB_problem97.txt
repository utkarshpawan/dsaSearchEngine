b'Given a collection of numbers, return all possible permutations.\nExample:\n[1,2,3] will have the following permutations:\n[1,2,3]\n[1,3,2]\n[2,1,3] \n[2,3,1] \n[3,1,2] \n[3,2,1]\n\n\n\nNOTE\n\nNo two entries in the permutation sequence should be the same.\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume that all the numbers in the collection are unique.\n\n\n\nWarning : DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTION FOR GENERATING PERMUTATIONS.\nExample : next_permutations in C++ / itertools.permutations in python.\nIf you do, we will disqualify your submission retroactively and give you penalty points.\n\n'
