b'Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).\nYou may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.\nExample 1:\nGiven intervals [1,3],[6,9] insert and merge [2,5] would result in [1,5],[6,9].\nExample 2:\nGiven [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] would result in [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].\nThis is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].\nMake sure the returned intervals are also sorted.\n'
