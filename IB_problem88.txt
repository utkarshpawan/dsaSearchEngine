b'Consider a two-player game played on a circular table of unspecified diameter.\n\nEach player has an infinite supply of coins, and take turns placing a coin on the table such that it is completely on the table and does not overlap with any other coins already played.\nA player wins if he makes the last legal move.\nWhich player (if any) has a strategy that will guarantee a win? Assume that the diameter of the table is greater than the diameter of the coin.\n'
