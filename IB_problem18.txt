b'Given an array of non-negative integers, A, of length N, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.\nEach element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.\nReturn the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index.\nIf it is not possible to reach the last index, return -1.\nInput Format:\nThe first and the only argument contains an integer array, A.\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn an integer, representing the answer as described in the problem statement.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= N <= 1e6\n0 <= A[i] <= 50000\n\n\nExamples:\nInput 1:\n    A = [2, 1, 1]\n\nOutput 1:\n    1\n    \nExplanation 1:\n    The shortest way to reach index 2 is\n        Index 0 -> Index 2\n    that requires only 1 jump.\n\nInput 2:\n    A = [2,3,1,1,4]\n\nOutput 2:\n    2\n\nExplanation 2:\n    The shortest way to reach index 4 is\n        Index 0 -> Index 1 -> Index 4\n    that requires 2 jumps.\n\n\n'
