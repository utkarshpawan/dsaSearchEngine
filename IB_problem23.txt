b'Given an array of non-negative integers, A, you are initially positioned at the 0th index of the array.\nEach element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.\nDetermine if you are able to reach the last index.\n\nInput Format:\nThe first and the only argument of input will be an integer array A.\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn an integer, representing the answer as described in the problem statement.\n    => 0 : If you cannot reach the last index.\n    => 1 : If you can reach the last index.\n\n\nConstraints:\n    1 <= len(A) <= 106\n    0 <= A[i] <= 30\nExamples:\nInput 1:\n    A = [2,3,1,1,4]\n\nOutput 1:\n    1\n\nExplanation 1:\n    Index 0 -> Index 2 -> Index 3 -> Index 4\n\nInput 2:\n    A = [3,2,1,0,4]\n\nOutput 2:\n    0\n\nExplanation 2:\n    There is no possible path to reach the last index.\n\n\n'
