b'You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.\nRotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).\nYou need to do this in place.\nNote that if you end up using an additional array, you will only receive partial score.\nExample:\nIf the array is\n[\n    [1, 2],\n    [3, 4]\n]\n\n\nThen the rotated array becomes:\n[\n    [3, 1],\n    [4, 2]\n]\n\n\n'
