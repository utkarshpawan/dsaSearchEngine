b'Say you have an array, A, for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.\nDesign an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most 2 transactions.\nReturn the maximum possible profit.\nNote: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).\n\nInput Format:\nThe first and the only argument is an integer array, A.\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn an integer, representing the maximum possible profit.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= length(A) <= 7e5\n1 <= A[i] <= 1e7\n\n\nExamples:\nInput 1:\n    A = [1, 2, 1, 2]\n\nOutput 1:\n    2\n\nExplanation 1: \n    Day 0 : Buy \n    Day 1 : Sell\n    Day 2 : Buy\n    Day 3 : Sell\n\nInput 2:\n    A = [7, 2, 4, 8, 7]\n\nOutput 2:\n    6\n\nExplanation 2:\n    Day 1 : Buy\n    Day 3 : Sell\n\n\n'
