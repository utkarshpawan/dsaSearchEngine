b'Given a matrix, A of size M x N of 0s and 1s. If an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0.\nNote: This will be evaluated on the extra memory used. Try to minimize the space and time complexity.\nInput Format:\nThe first and the only argument of input contains a 2-d integer matrix, A, of size M x N.\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn a 2-d matrix that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= N, M <= 1000\n0 <= A[i][j] <= 1\n\nExamples:\nInput 1:\n    [   [1, 0, 1],\n        [1, 1, 1], \n        [1, 1, 1]   ]\n\nOutput 1:\n    [   [0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 1],\n        [1, 0, 1]   ]\n\nInput 2:\n    [   [1, 0, 1],\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [1, 0, 1]   ]\n\nOutput 2:\n    [   [0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 1],\n        [0, 0, 0]   ]\n\n\n'
