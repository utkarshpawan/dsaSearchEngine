b'Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.\nTry to solve it in linear time/space.\nExample :\nInput : [1, 10, 5]\nOutput : 5 \n\n\nReturn 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.\n\nYou may assume that all the elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.\nYou may also assume that the difference will not overflow.\n\n'
