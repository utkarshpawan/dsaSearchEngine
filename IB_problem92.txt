b'There is a building of 100 floors\nIf an egg drops from the Nth floor or above it will break. If it\xe2\x80\x99s dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You\xe2\x80\x99re given 2 eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.\nThese are very strong eggs, because they can be dropped multiple times without breaking as long as they are dropped from floors below their \xe2\x80\x9cthreshold\xe2\x80\x9d floor, floor N. But once an egg is dropped from a floor above it\xe2\x80\x99s threshold floor, it will break.\nOutput the minimum number of drops required to figure out N.\n\nAnswer is a integer.  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.\nFeel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions\n\n'
