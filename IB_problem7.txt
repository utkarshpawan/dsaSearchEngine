b'Given two sequences A, B, count number of unique ways in sequence A, to form a subsequence that is identical to the sequence B.\nSubsequence : A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, \xe2\x80\x9cACE\xe2\x80\x9d is a subsequence of \xe2\x80\x9cABCDE\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cAEC\xe2\x80\x9d is not).\nInput Format:\nThe first argument of input contains a string, A.\nThe second argument of input contains a string, B.\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn an integer representing the answer as described in the problem statement.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= length(A), length(B) <= 700\n\n\nExample :\nInput 1:\n    A = "abc"\n    B = "abc"\n    \nOutput 1:\n    1\n\nExplanation 1:\n    Both the strings are equal.\n\nInput 2:\n    A = "rabbbit" \n    B = "rabbit"\n\nOutput 2:\n    3\n\nExplanation 2:\n    These are the possible removals of characters:\n        => A = "ra_bbit" \n        => A = "rab_bit" \n        => A = "rabb_it"\n        \n    Note: "_" marks the removed character.\n\n\n'
