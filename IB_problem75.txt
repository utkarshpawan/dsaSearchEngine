b'There are 100 doors, all closed. \nIn a nearby cage are 100 monkeys.\nThe first monkey is let out and runs along the doors opening every one. \nThe second monkey is then let out and runs along the doors closing the 2nd, 4th, 6th,\xe2\x80\xa6  - all the even-numbered doors. \nThe third monkey is let out. He attends only to the 3rd, 6th, 9th,\xe2\x80\xa6 doors (every third door, in other words), closing any that is open and opening any that is closed, and so on. \nAfter all 100 monkeys have done their work in this way, what state are the doors in after the last pass?\nAnswer with the number of open doors.\n\nAnswer is an integer.  Just put the number without any decimal places if it\xe2\x80\x99s an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.\nFeel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions\n\n'
