b'The set [1,2,3,\xe2\x80\xa6,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.\nBy listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,\nWe get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3 ) :\n1. "123"\n2. "132"\n3. "213"\n4. "231"\n5. "312"\n6. "321"\n\n\nGiven n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.\nFor example, given n = 3, k = 4, ans = "231"\n\nGood questions to ask the interviewer :\n\nWhat if n is greater than 10. How should multiple digit numbers be represented in string?\n      \nIn this case, just concatenate the number to the answer.\n so if n = 11, k = 1, ans = "1234567891011"\n\n\nWhats the maximum value of n and k?\n      \nIn this case, k will be a positive integer thats less than INT_MAX.\nn is reasonable enough to make sure the answer does not bloat up a lot.\n\n\n\n\n'
