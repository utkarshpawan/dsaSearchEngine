b"Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits, add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ).\nThe digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.\nNOTE: Certain things are intentionally left unclear in this question which you should practice asking the interviewer. For example: \nfor this problem, following are some good questions to ask :\n\nQ : Can the input have 0's before the most significant digit. Or in other words, is 0 1 2 3 a valid input?\nA : For the purpose of this question, YES\nQ : Can the output have 0's before the most significant digit? Or in other words, is 0 1 2 4 a valid output?\nA : For the purpose of this question, NO. Even if the input has zeroes before the most significant digit.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
