b'There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.\nYou are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:\n1. Each child must have at least one candy.\n2. Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.\n\n\nWhat is the minimum candies you must give?\nInput Format:\nThe first and the only argument contains N integers in an array A.\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn an integer, representing the minimum candies to be given.\n\n\nExample:\nInput 1:\n    A = [1, 2]\n\nOutput 1:\n    3\n\nExplanation 1:\n    The candidate with 1 rating gets 1 candy and candidate with rating cannot get 1 candy as 1 is its neighbor. \n    So rating 2 candidate gets 2 candies. In total, 2 + 1 = 3 candies need to be given out.\n\nInput 2:\n    A = [1, 5, 2, 1]\n\nOutput 2:\n    7\n\nExplanation 2:\n    Candies given = [1, 3, 2, 1]\n\n\n'
