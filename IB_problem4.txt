b'Find the longest increasing subsequence of a given array of integers, A.\nIn other words, find a subsequence of array in which the subsequence\xe2\x80\x99s elements are in strictly increasing order, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. \nThis subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.\nIn this case, we only care about the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\nInput Format:\nThe first and the only argument is an integer array A.\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn an integer representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= length(A) <= 2500\n1 <= A[i] <= 2000\n\n\nExample :\nInput 1:\n    A = [1, 2, 1, 5]\n\nOutput 1:\n    3\n    \nExplanation 1:\n    The sequence : [1, 2, 5]\n\nInput 2:\n    A = [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15]\n    \nOutput 2:\n    6\n\nExplanation 2:\n    The sequence : [0, 2, 6, 9, 13, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15]\n\n\n'
