# algozenith-web-hackathon

You have to first scrap text files from different sites such as codeforces. codechef, leetcode, Interviewbit. I uploaded some of the extracted files and python code to extract them from different sites. And then you have to run the index.js file on local server. I used a module tf-idf-search for finding keywords and similarity index.
