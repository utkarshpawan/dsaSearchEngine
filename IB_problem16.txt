b'Given a string A, partition A such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.\nReturn the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of A.\n\nInput Format:\nThe first and the only argument contains the string A.\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn an integer, representing the answer as described in the problem statement.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= length(A) <= 501\n\n\nExamples:\nInput 1:\n    A = "aba"\n\nOutput 1:\n    0\n\nExplanation 1:\n    "aba" is already a palindrome, so no cuts are needed.\n\nInput 2:\n    A = "aab"\n    \nOutput 2:\n    1\n\nExplanation 2:\n    Return 1 since the palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.\n\n\n'
