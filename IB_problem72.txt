b'A robot is located at the top-left corner of an A x B grid (marked \xe2\x80\x98Start\xe2\x80\x99 in the diagram below).\n\nThe robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked \xe2\x80\x98Finish\xe2\x80\x99 in the diagram below).\nHow many possible unique paths are there?\nNote: A and B will be such that the resulting answer fits in a 32 bit signed integer.\nExample :\nInput : A = 2, B = 2\nOutput : 2\n\n2 possible routes : (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) \n              OR  : (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1)\n\n\n'
