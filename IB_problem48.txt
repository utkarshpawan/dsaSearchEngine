b'Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.\n\n\npush(x) \xe2\x80\x93 Push element x onto stack.\npop() \xe2\x80\x93 Removes the element on top of the stack.\ntop() \xe2\x80\x93 Get the top element.\ngetMin() \xe2\x80\x93 Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.\n\n\nNote that all the operations have to be constant time operations.\nQuestions to ask the interviewer :\nQ: What should getMin() do on empty stack? \nA: In this case, return -1.\n\nQ: What should pop do on empty stack? \nA: In this case, nothing. \n\nQ: What should top() do on empty stack?\nA: In this case, return -1\n\n\n\nNOTE : If you are using your own declared global variables, make sure to clear them out in the constructor.\n\n'
