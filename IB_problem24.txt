b'Given A, B, C, find whether C is formed by the interleaving of A and B.\nInput Format:*\nThe first argument of input contains a string, A.\nThe second argument of input contains a string, B.\nThe third argument of input contains a string, C.\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn an integer, 0 or 1:\n    => 0 : False\n    => 1 : True\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= length(A), length(B), length(C) <= 150\n\n\nExamples:\nInput 1:\n    A = "aabcc"\n    B = "dbbca"\n    C = "aadbbcbcac"\n\nOutput 1:\n    1\n    \nExplanation 1:\n    "aa" (from A) + "dbbc" (from B) + "bc" (from A) + "a" (from B) + "c" (from A)\n\nInput 2:\n    A = "aabcc"\n    B = "dbbca"\n    C = "aadbbbaccc"\n\nOutput 2:\n    0\n\nExplanation 2:\n    It is not possible to get C by interleaving A and B.\n\n\n'
