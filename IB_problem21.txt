b'Given a string A and a dictionary of words B, determine if A can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.\nInput Format:\nThe first argument is a string, A.\nThe second argument is an array of strings, B.\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= len(A) <= 6500\n1 <= len(B) <= 10000\n1 <= len(B[i]) <= 20\n\n\nExamples:\nInput 1:\n    A = "myinterviewtrainer",\n    B = ["trainer", "my", "interview"]\n\nOutput 1:\n    1\n\nExplanation 1:\n    Return 1 ( corresponding to true ) because "myinterviewtrainer" can be segmented as "my interview trainer".\n    \nInput 2:\n    A = "a"\n    B = ["aaa"]\n\nOutput 2:\n    0\n\nExplanation 2:\n    Return 0 ( corresponding to false ) because "a" cannot be segmented as "aaa".\n\n\n'
