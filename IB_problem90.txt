b'In your cellar there are three light switches in the OFF position. Each switch controls one of three light bulbs on floor above. \nYou may move any of the switches but you may only go upstairs to inspect the bulbs. \nWhen upstairs, you cannot access the switches. What is the minimum number of times you need to go upstairs to determine the switch for each bulb?\n\nSince your answer is a integer, just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.\n\n'
