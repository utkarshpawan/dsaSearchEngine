b'Say you have an array, A, for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.\nDesign an algorithm to find the maximum profit.\nYou may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).\nHowever, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).\nInput Format:\n\nThe first and the only argument is an array of integer, A.\n\nOutput Format:\n\nReturn an integer, representing the maximum possible profit.\n\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= len(A) <= 1e5\n1 <= A[i] <= 1e7\n\nExample:\nInput 1:\n    A = [1, 2, 3]\n\nOutput 1:\n    2\n\nExplanation 1:\n    => Buy a stock on day 0.\n    => Sell the stock on day 1. (Profit +1)\n    => Buy a stock on day 1.\n    => Sell the stock on day 2. (Profit +1)\n\nOverall profit = 2\n\n\nInput 2:\n    A = [5, 2, 10]\n\nOutput 2:\n    8\n\nExplanation 2:\n    => Buy a stock on day 1.\n    => Sell the stock on on day 2. (Profit +8)\n\nOverall profit = 8\n'
