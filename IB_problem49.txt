b"Given an index k, return the kth row of the Pascal's triangle.\nPascal's triangle: To generate A[C] in row R, sum up A'[C] and A'[C-1] from previous row R - 1.\nExample:\nInput : k = 3\n\nReturn : [1,3,3,1]\n\nNote: k is 0 based. k = 0, corresponds to the row [1]. \nNote: Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?"
