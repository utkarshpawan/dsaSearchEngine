b'Implement the next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the numerically next greater permutation of numbers for a given array A of size N.\nIf such arrangement is not possible, it must be rearranged as the lowest possible order i.e., sorted in an ascending order.\nNote:\n1. The replacement must be in-place, do **not** allocate extra memory.\n2. DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTION FOR NEXT PERMUTATION. Use of Library functions will disqualify your submission retroactively and will give you penalty points.\n\n\nInput Format:\nThe first and the only argument of input has an array of integers, A.\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn an array of integers, representing the next permutation of the given array.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= N <= 5e5\n1 <= A[i] <= 1e9\n\n\nExamples:\nInput 1:\n    A = [1, 2, 3]\n\nOutput 1:\n    [1, 3, 2]\n\nInput 2:\n    A = [3, 2, 1]\n\nOutput 2:\n    [1, 2, 3]\n\nInput 3:\n    A = [1, 1, 5]\n\nOutput 3:\n    [1, 5, 1]\n\nInput 4:\n    A = [20, 50, 113]\n\nOutput 4:\n    [20, 113, 50]\n\n\n'
